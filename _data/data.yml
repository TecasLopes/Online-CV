    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      My name is Teresa Lopes and I’m Portuguese. I’ve moved to the UK from sunny Portugal five years ago to pursue a better life. Up until now I was working as a nurse, however I needed a career change, so I decided to take my love for people and caring to the next level, by emerging myself in the world of people’s profession. I love working with people and that’s why I am so excited to start my career in the Human Resources area.
      In my role as a nurse, I developed essential knowledge and skills transferable to my new area of interest, Human Resources, such as communication and relational skills, time management, teamwork, conflict resolution, performance reviews, leadership and even stress management.
      Ive completed a diploma in Leadership & Management, which has provided me with an amazing insight into the relevance of appropriate management and leadership in the workplace. Im currently finishing the CIPD level 5 diploma in Human Resources Management, which has equipped me with amazing tools to be able to continue my work caring for people. Im also currently attending the Damia Group Tech Recruitment Academy. 
      Im fluent in English, but also Portuguese and Spanish, and I’m presently working on my French! 
      Im enthusiastic and eager to learn, I’m quick on my feet, organized, resourceful, reliable, creative, a perfectionist (which sounds like a flaw, but it means I’ll always give my absolute best in any task), I’m very sociable and a great communicator… talking to people comes natural to me. I’m also not afraid to be original and unconventional!
      Im currently looking for a job in Tech recruitment!
